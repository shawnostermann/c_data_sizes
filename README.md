# c_data_sizes
What are the sizes of shorts, ints, longs, floats, doubles, size_t, pid_t, etc. etc. on the current computer/OS/Compiler???

Nothing profound, just a program I've been pulling around for decades as a really quick way to find out 
what the roll-over boundaries are on some new computer.

You should just be able to type "make c_data_types" and gnu make will know what to do even without a Makefile
